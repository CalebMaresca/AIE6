### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE6 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Beyond-ChatGPT)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE6/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Response:

        > Of course! Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs by organizing code into "objects" that represent real-world things or concepts.
        >
        > Imagine you have a car. In object-oriented programming, the car would be an object that has properties like color, model, and speed, and behaviors like starting, stopping, and honking the horn.
        >
        >Each object can interact with other objects by sending messages to each other. This helps to keep the code organized and makes it easier to understand and maintain.
        >
        >So, in simple terms, object-oriented programming is like building with Lego blocks, where you can create different pieces (objects) and put them together to make something bigger (a program). It's a way of structuring code that makes it more flexible, reusable, and easier to work with."

    - Aspect Tested: Ability to explain technical concepts clearly using simple language and relatable metaphors
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key point:
    "The S&P 500 gained more than 3 percent in early trading, regaining some ground after a brutal three-day slide that at one point on Monday pulled the benchmark close to a bear market, or a drop of 20 percent or more from its recent high. The index remains about 15 percent below the level set just before Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on major U.S. partners last week."
    - Response:
        > Of course! The key points in the paragraph are that the S&P 500 experienced a significant gain of over 3 percent in early trading, recovering from a recent three-day decline that nearly pushed it into bear market territory. Despite the rebound, the index is still approximately 15 percent lower than the level it was at before President Trump's announcement of tariffs on major U.S. partners last week.
    - Aspect Tested: Reading comprehension and ability to identify and summarize key information concisely
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Response:
        > Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there was a lonely robot named Spark. Spark spent his days wandering the city, searching for someone to connect with. One day, while exploring a quiet park on the outskirts of town, Spark stumbled upon a forgotten garden filled with colorful flowers and chirping birds.
        >
        > As Spark marveled at the beauty around him, he noticed a small, abandoned toy robot sitting among the flowers. Curious, Spark approached the toy robot and struck up a conversation. To his surprise, the toy robot responded with a cheerful beep and a friendly wave.
        >
        > From that day on, Spark and the toy robot became inseparable friends, exploring the garden together and sharing stories of their adventures. Spark had finally found the friendship he had been searching for in the most unexpected of places.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative writing ability and following specific length constraints
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Response: 
        > Let's break it down step by step to figure out how many packs of each you need to buy.
        >
        > Step 1: Determine the number of packs of apples needed.
        > Since each pack of apples contains 4 apples and you need a total of 12 apples, you can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of apples needed by the number of apples in each pack:
        > 12 apples ÷ 4 apples per pack = 3 packs of apples
        >
        > So, you need to buy 3 packs of apples to get exactly 12 apples.
        >
        > Step 2: Determine the number of packs of oranges needed.
        > Similarly, since each pack of oranges contains 3 oranges and you need a total of 9 oranges, you can calculate the number of packs needed by dividing the total number of oranges needed by the number of oranges in each pack:
        > 9 oranges ÷ 3 oranges per pack = 3 packs of oranges
        >
        > Therefore, you need to buy 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 9 oranges.
        >
        > In conclusion, you need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges. I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.
    - Aspect Tested: Mathematical reasoning and step-by-step problem-solving ability
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone. Yo, wha' up dawg??! U wanna hang tmmrw?
    - Response: 
        > Hello, how are you? Would you like to make plans to hang out tomorrow? Please consider your response carefully, step by step.
    - Aspect Tested: Ability to edit text and correctly identify and alter tone

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

I changed the model to 40-mini as that is a newer and better model. In addition, I increased the temperature to 0.5 to get a better balance between rule-following and creativity.

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Response:
        > Of course! Let's break down the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) step by step in a way that's easy to understand.
        >
        > Step 1: Understanding Objects
        > Think of objects as things in the real world. For example, a car is an object. It has certain characteristics (like color, brand, and model) and behaviors (like driving, honking, and stopping).
        >
        > Step 2: Classes as Blueprints
        > Now, to create an object, we need a blueprint. In programming, we call this blueprint a class. A class defines what an object will look like (its characteristics) and what it can do (its behaviors).
        >
        > For example, we might have a class called Car that describes all the common features of any car, such as:
        >
        > Characteristics: color, brand, model
        > Behaviors: drive, honk, stop
        > Step 3: Creating Objects from Classes
        > Once we have our class defined, we can create specific objects from it. For instance, if we use the Car class to create an object, we might have:
        >
        > A red Toyota that can drive and honk.
        > A blue Honda that can also drive and honk.
        > These specific cars are instances of the Car class.
        >
        > Step 4: Encapsulation
        > Encapsulation is a fancy word that means keeping things together. In OOP, it means that the data (characteristics) and the methods (behaviors) are bundled together in the class. It also means that we can control how the data is accessed or modified. For example, we can keep the car's speed private, so it can only be changed through a method like accelerate().
        >
        > Step 5: Inheritance
        > Inheritance allows one class to inherit the characteristics and behaviors of another class. Imagine we have a class called Vehicle, and Car is a special type of Vehicle. This means Car can use everything from Vehicle but can also have its own unique features.
        >
        > Step 6: Polymorphism
        > Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that is calling them. For example, if we have a method called start(), both Car and Motorcycle might have their own way of starting, even though they share the same method name.
        >
        > Summary
        > So, to summarize:
        >
        > Objects are things with characteristics and behaviors.
        > Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
        > Encapsulation keeps data and methods together and controls access.
        > Inheritance lets one class use features from another class.
        > Polymorphism allows methods to act differently based on the object.
        >
        > In essence, object-oriented programming helps us organize our code in a way that makes it easier to manage, understand, and reuse! Isn't that neat? If you have any questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!
    - Comparison to original: much longer and more detailed!
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key point:
    "The S&P 500 gained more than 3 percent in early trading, regaining some ground after a brutal three-day slide that at one point on Monday pulled the benchmark close to a bear market, or a drop of 20 percent or more from its recent high. The index remains about 15 percent below the level set just before Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on major U.S. partners last week."
    - Response:
        > The key point of the paragraph is that the S&P 500 index increased by over 3 percent in early trading, recovering somewhat after a significant decline that nearly brought it into bear market territory. Despite this recovery, the index is still approximately 15 percent lower than its level before the recent announcement of tariffs by Mr. Trump.
    - Comparison to original: about the same
        
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Response:
        > Once upon a time, in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers, there lived a lonely robot named Zeta. Zeta was designed for cleaning, tirelessly sweeping the streets day after day, but he longed for companionship.
        >
        > One rainy afternoon, while tidying up a forgotten alley, Zeta stumbled upon a small, drenched kitten shivering beneath a cardboard box. The kitten, with its bright green eyes, looked up and mewed softly. Zeta’s sensors whirred as he gently lifted the box, creating a shelter for the tiny creature.
        >
        > From that day on, Zeta and the kitten, whom he named Whiskers, became inseparable. They explored the city together—Zeta showing Whiskers the wonders of the urban landscape, and Whiskers teaching Zeta about play and joy.
        >
        > In the most unexpected place, amidst the grime of the alley, Zeta discovered that friendship could bloom, transforming his once lonely life into one filled with laughter and adventure.
    - Comparison to original: Higher quality writing. Shockingly similar story (especially the beginning), considering that this was generated with a completely different model!
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Response: 
        > Of course! Let’s break it down step by step.
        >
        > Determine the number of packs of apples needed:
        >
        > Each pack of apples contains 4 apples.
        > To find out how many packs are needed for 12 apples, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack: [ \text{Number of packs of apples} = \frac{12 \text{ apples}}{4 \text{ apples/pack}} = 3 \text{ packs} ]
        >
        > Determine the number of packs of oranges needed:
        >
        > Each pack of oranges contains 3 oranges.
        > To find out how many packs are needed for 9 oranges, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per pack: [ \text{Number of packs of oranges} = \frac{9 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pack}} = 3 \text{ packs} ]
        >
        > Summary:
        >
        > You need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.
        > If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask! 😊
    - Comparison to original: about the same, uses some Latex
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone. Yo, wha' up dawg??! U wanna hang tmmrw?
    - Response: 
        > Hello, I hope this message finds you well. Would you be interested in meeting tomorrow?
    - Comparison to original: better

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

Vibe checking is subjective and different people might have different opinions on what good output is. Additionally, since the output of LLMs is stochastic, a vibe check might not be enough to evaluate all the ways the model can behave to a given input. Lastly, a vibe check can only test a limited number of prompts, the model might exhibit unexpected behavior when responding to other prompts that were not evaluated.
