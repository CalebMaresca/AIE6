We got audio input and output from OpenAI in October, then November saw SmolVLM from Hugging Face and December saw image and video models from Amazon Nova.\nIn October I upgraded my LLM CLI tool to support multi-modal models via attachments.

They followed that up with a vision reasoning model called QvQ on December 24th, which I also ran locally.\nDeepSeek made their DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview model available to try out through their chat interface on November 20th.\nTo understand more about inference scaling I recommend Is AI progress slowing down? by Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor.", "e8a915e5-8382-4cd4-83d7-3c57f2e992c4": "Nothing yet from Anthropic or Meta but I would be very surprised if they don\u2019t have their own inference-scaling models in the works.

Vibe benchmarks (aka the Chatbot Arena) currently rank it 7th, just behind the Gemini 2.0 and OpenAI 4o/o1 models. This is by far the highest ranking openly licensed model.\nThe really impressive thing about DeepSeek v3 is the training cost. The model was trained on 2,788,000 H800 GPU hours at an estimated cost of $5,576,000. Llama 3.1 405B trained 30,840,000 GPU hours\u201411x that used by DeepSeek v3, for a model that benchmarks slightly worse.", "3dd4ae52-da26-4aea-861a-3b7d94408f6a": "Those US export regulations on GPUs to China seem to have inspired some very effective training optimizations!\nThe environmental impact got better\nA welcome result of the increased efficiency of the models\u2014both the hosted ones and the ones I can run locally\u2014is that the energy usage and environmental impact of running a prompt has dropped enormously over the past couple of years.\nOpenAI themselves are charging 100x less for a prompt compared to the GPT-3 days.

The impact is likely neglible compared to driving a car down the street or maybe even watching a video on YouTube.\nLikewise, training. DeepSeek v3 training for less than $6m is a fantastic sign that training costs can and should continue to drop.\nFor less efficient models I find it useful to compare their energy usage to commercial flights. The largest Llama 3 model cost about the same as a single digit number of fully loaded passenger flights from New York to London. That\u2019s certainly not nothing, but once trained that model can be used by millions of people at no extra training cost.", "f7f0f514-605c-448a-85f5-a0cdfcba95d3": "The environmental impact got much, much worse\nThe much bigger problem here is the enormous competitive buildout of the infrastructure that is imagined to be necessary for these models in the future.\nCompanies like Google, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon are all spending billions of dollars rolling out new datacenters, with a very material impact on the electricity grid and the environment. There\u2019s even talk of spinning up new nuclear power stations, but those can take decades.\nIs this infrastructure necessary? DeepSeek v3\u2019s $6m training cost and the continued crash in LLM prices might hint that it\u2019s not.

In organic datasets, the relationship between tokens is often complex and indirect. Many reasoning steps may be required to connect the current token to the next, making it challenging for the model to learn effectively from next-token prediction. By contrast, each token generated by a language model is by definition predicted by the preceding tokens, making it easier for a model to follow the resulting reasoning patterns.", "478bd3af-8d2e-41ba-be56-1e52c09a0ab7": "Another common technique is to use larger models to help create training data for their smaller, cheaper alternatives\u2014a trick used by an increasing number of labs.

about AI in 2023\n31st December 2023\n2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it\u2019s OK to call these AI\u2014they\u2019re the latest and (currently) most interesting development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that dates back to the 1950s.\nHere\u2019s my attempt to round up the highlights in one place!", "2836ee9c-765c-4056-a407-bfe8479f6b0c": "Large Language Models\nThey\u2019re actually quite easy to build\nYou can run LLMs on your own devices\nHobbyists can build their own fine-tuned models\nWe don\u2019t yet know how to build GPT-4\nVibes Based Development\nLLMs are really smart, and also really, really dumb\nGullibility is the biggest unsolved problem\nCode may be the best application\nThe ethics of this space remain diabolically complex\nMy blog in 2023", "0a7f9798-4908-4390-8aae-ac4c4263110d": "Here\u2019s the sequel to this post: Things we learned about LLMs in 2024.\nLarge Language Models\nIn the past 24-36 months, our species has discovered that you can take a GIANT corpus of text, run it through a pile of GPUs, and use it to create a fascinating new kind of software.\nLLMs can do a lot of things. They can answer questions, summarize documents, translate from one language to another, extract information and even write surprisingly competent code.\nThey can also help you cheat at your homework, generate unlimited streams of fake content and be used for all manner of nefarious purposes.", "3f99b32b-d8cd-442d-9a63-3d444e9dfdb3": "So far, I think they\u2019re a net positive. I\u2019ve used them on a personal level to improve my productivity (and entertain myself) in all sorts of different ways. I think people who learn how to use them effectively can gain a significant boost to their quality of life.\nA lot of people are yet to be sold on their value! Some think their negatives outweigh their positives, some think they are all hot air, and some even think they represent an existential threat to humanity.\nThey\u2019re actually quite easy to build\nThe most surprising thing we\u2019ve learned about LLMs this year is that they\u2019re actually quite easy to build."}}
