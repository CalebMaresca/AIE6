We\u2019ve been talking about them all year, but I\u2019ve seen few if any examples of them running in production, despite lots of exciting prototypes.\nI think this is because of gullibility.\nCan we solve this? Honestly, I\u2019m beginning to suspect that you can\u2019t fully solve gullibility without achieving AGI. So it may be quite a while before those agent dreams can really start to come true!\nCode may be the best application\nOver the course of the year, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that writing code is one of the things LLMs are most capable of.", "3af117e7-52a0-402c-8b5e-63ffff453810": "If you think about what they do, this isn\u2019t such a big surprise. The grammar rules of programming languages like Python and JavaScript are massively less complicated than the grammar of Chinese, Spanish or English.\nIt\u2019s still astonishing to me how effective they are though.\nOne of the great weaknesses of LLMs is their tendency to hallucinate\u2014to imagine things that don\u2019t correspond to reality. You would expect this to be a particularly bad problem for code\u2014if an LLM hallucinates a method that doesn\u2019t exist, the code should be useless.", "6b664e81-2689-4dcb-be7e-a64bdb711769": "Except... you can run generated code to see if it\u2019s correct. And with patterns like ChatGPT Code Interpreter the LLM can execute the code itself, process the error message, then rewrite it and keep trying until it works!\nSo hallucination is a much lesser problem for code generation than for anything else. If only we had the equivalent of Code Interpreter for fact-checking natural language!\nHow should we feel about this as software engineers?\nOn the one hand, this feels like a threat: who needs a programmer if ChatGPT can write code for you?", "a8851295-6a56-4c30-85bb-929db600af91": "On the other hand, as software engineers we are better placed to take advantage of this than anyone else. We\u2019ve all been given weird coding interns\u2014we can use our deep knowledge to prompt them to solve coding problems more effectively than anyone else can.\nThe ethics of this space remain diabolically complex\nIn September last year Andy Baio and I produced the first major story on the unlicensed training data behind Stable Diffusion.\nSince then, almost every major LLM (and most of the image generation models) have also been trained on unlicensed data.", "b97972c3-6b9f-4a18-bbac-fe9eb95c8a98": "Just this week, the New York Times launched a landmark lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft over this issue. The 69 page PDF is genuinely worth reading\u2014especially the first few pages, which lay out the issues in a way that\u2019s surprisingly easy to follow. The rest of the document includes some of the clearest explanations of what LLMs are, how they work and how they are built that I\u2019ve read anywhere.\nThe legal arguments here are complex. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I don\u2019t think this one will be easily decided. Whichever way it goes, I expect this case to have a profound impact on how this technology develops in the future.", "486fb015-608c-40df-a3a6-5355c75db25e": "Law is not ethics. Is it OK to train models on people\u2019s content without their permission, when those models will then be used in ways that compete with those people?\nAs the quality of results produced by AI models has increased over the year, these questions have become even more pressing.\nThe impact on human society in terms of these models is already huge, if difficult to objectively measure.\nPeople have certainly lost work to them\u2014anecdotally, I\u2019ve seen this for copywriters, artists and translators.\nThere are a great deal of untold stories here. I\u2019m hoping 2024 sees significant amounts of dedicated journalism on this topic.\nMy blog in 2023\nHere\u2019s a tag cloud for content I posted to my blog in 2023 (generated using Django SQL Dashboard):", "04465d37-b841-4d96-94d4-0f97783eff71": "The top five: ai (342), generativeai (300), llms (287), openai (86), chatgpt (78).\nI\u2019ve written a lot about this stuff!\nI grabbed a screenshot of my Plausible analytics for the year, fed that to ChatGPT Vision, told it to extract the data into a table, then got it to mix in entry titles (from a SQL query it wrote) and produced this table with it.
